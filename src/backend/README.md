# Backend Directory

This directory contains server-side logic and API integrations for the Solana wallet application.

## Structure

- `api/` - API endpoint handlers and HTTP clients
- `services/` - Business logic and data processing
- `models/` - Data models and database schemas
- `utils/` - Backend-specific utility functions
- `config/` - Configuration files and environment variables

## Usage

This directory is prepared for future backend integrations including:
- Real Solana blockchain API calls
- Token metadata fetching
- Transaction processing
- User authentication
- Data persistence

For now, the frontend uses mock data from `src/services/` directory.
