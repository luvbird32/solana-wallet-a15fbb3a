# Backend Services

This folder contains the server-side logic and business rules for the Solana wallet application.

## 📁 What's Inside

### Core Services
- **`services/`** - Main business logic (wallet operations, token management, security)
- **`api/`** - API endpoints and external service connections
- **`config/`** - Application settings and network configurations

### Supporting Files
- **`models/`** - Data structures and database schemas
- **`utils/`** - Helper functions and utilities
- **`smart-contracts/`** - Blockchain smart contracts

## 🔧 Key Features

### Wallet Management
- Create and import wallets securely
- Generate seed phrases safely
- Manage multiple wallet accounts

### Token Operations
- Search tokens by name or address
- Fetch token balances and metadata
- Cache token information for better performance

### Security Features
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization

## 🏗️ Architecture

The backend follows a modular design:

```
backend/
├── services/           # Business logic
│   ├── walletService.ts
│   ├── tokenService.ts
│   └── securityService.ts
├── api/               # External connections
├── config/            # Settings
└── utils/             # Helper functions
```

## 🚀 Development

### Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run tests: `npm test`

### Testing
- Unit tests for all services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Security tests for encryption functions

## 🔐 Security

Security is our top priority:
- All sensitive data is encrypted
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Secure random number generation

## 📈 Future Plans

- Real API endpoints (currently using mock data)
- Database integration
- User authentication system
- Advanced transaction features
