# Smart Contracts

This folder contains blockchain programs (smart contracts) for enhanced wallet functionality on the Solana network.

## 🎯 Purpose

Smart contracts extend our wallet's capabilities by providing:
- Custom token operations
- Multi-signature wallet features
- Staking and rewards programs
- Advanced security features

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before working with these contracts, you'll need:
- [Rust programming language](https://rustup.rs/)
- [Solana CLI tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools)
- [Anchor framework](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/) (recommended)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Workflow

1. **Build Contracts**
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   anchor test
   ```

3. **Deploy to Test Network**
   ```bash
   solana config set --url devnet
   anchor deploy
   ```

4. **Deploy to Main Network** (Production)
   ```bash
   solana config set --url mainnet-beta
   anchor deploy
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Network Settings
Update these files when deploying:
- `Anchor.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `src/utils/solanaPrograms.ts` - Frontend integration

### Environment Setup
1. Set your Solana network (devnet/mainnet)
2. Configure your wallet for deployment
3. Ensure sufficient SOL for deployment fees

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### Development
- Always test on devnet first
- Write comprehensive tests for all functions
- Use proper access controls
- Follow Solana security guidelines

### Deployment
- Use multi-signature wallets for upgrades
- Audit code before mainnet deployment
- Monitor deployed contracts
- Keep upgrade authority secure

## 🧪 Testing

Our testing strategy includes:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Security tests for edge cases
- Performance tests for optimization
